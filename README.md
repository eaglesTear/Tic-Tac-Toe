# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple build of Tic-Tac-Toe, or Noughts and Crosses, with some dynamic DOM elements and styling.

Two-player game. 

Game keeps track of whose turn it is next and allows you to enter your names, so just look for the messages at the top of the screen.

Awards a trophy to the winner ;)
